# Artemis Global Tracker: Tools

## Repository Contents
- **/Artemis_Global_Tracker_Configuration_Tool** - A Python3 PyQt5 tool to configure the full GlobalTracker example via USB and remotely via Iridium messaging
- **/Artemis_Global_Tracker_Mapping_Tools** - A set of tools which will allow you to: download messages from the Tracker via a GMail account; stitch the messages together into a single .csv file;
convert the .csv file into .kml files for Google Earth; and display the real-time paths and locations of up to eight Trackers using the Google Static Maps API. The tools are very similar to those written
for the [Iridium_9603_Beacon](https://github.com/PaulZC/Iridium_9603_Beacon/blob/master/RockBLOCK.md#tracking-your-beacon-with-an-internet-connection) but are updated for the Tracker,
using Python3 and PyQt5.
